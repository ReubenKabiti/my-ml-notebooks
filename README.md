# Machine Learning Projects (2023–2024)

This repo contains a collection of machine learning projects and experiments I worked on between 2023 and 2024. It’s a mix of classic ML models, deep learning experiments, diffusion models, small NLP tools, image-processing tests, and other random ideas I built while learning and improving my ML skills.

Each project lives in its own folder with code, notes, and results. The goal of this repo is to track my progress, document what I’ve learned, and keep all my ML work in one place.

I will keep adding more notebooks as I find them. They are scattered everywhere on my pc hehe.

## What’s Inside (Or should be inside, still looking for the lost ones)

- Classification & regression models
- CNNs, autoencoders, and basic deep learning experiments
- Denoising diffusion model (DDPM)
- Variational Autoencoders
- Generative Adversarial Networks
- Image preprocessing & augmentation tools
- NLP mini-projects
- Math + ML experiment notebooks
- Miscellaneous tests and exploratory code

## Goals of the Repo

- Document my ML learning journey
- Experiment with new ideas and techniques
- Build a reference for future projects

Feel free to explore, fork, or use any part of it for learning!
